Better npm publish


## Features
* Ensures the working directory is clean and that there are no unpulled changes
* Runs your checks before publishing via npm scripts
* Bumps the package version and creates git tag
* Publishes new version to npm
* Pushes commits and tags to GitHub

## Install

```sh
npm install -g pmm
```

## Usage

```sh
pmm [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]
# default: patch
```

If you define **"prepare"** script in **package.json** it will be run before every publish.
Also you can use **prepublish** or **preversion** npm scripts to run checks before publishing.
