## Install

```sh
npm install -g pmm
```

## Usage

```sh
pmm [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease] [<npmtag>]
# default version: patch
# default npm tag: latest
```

If you define **"pmm:prepare"** script in **package.json** it will be run before every publish. Also you can use **prepublish** or **preversion** npm scripts to run checks before publishing.
